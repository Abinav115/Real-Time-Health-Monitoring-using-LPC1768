# Real-Time-Health-Monitoring-using-LPC1768
Here's a condensed description:  This LPC1768 project simulates and displays health metrics (temperature, oxygen, heart rate, blood pressure) on an LCD, with data transmitted via UART. Critical values trigger LED alerts. Key features include UART at 9600 bps and visual alerts, with potential for real sensors and wireless communication.
